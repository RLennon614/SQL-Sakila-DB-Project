# SQL-Sakila-DB-Project
🎥 Sakila Database Analysis & SQL Portfolio

This repository showcases my expertise in SQL (MySQL dialect) by providing comprehensive queries, procedures, and scripts designed to extract business intelligence from the classic Sakila Sample Database (a fictional DVD rental store).

🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective of this repository is to demonstrate advanced SQL proficiency in the context of a relational database, focusing on key business areas like inventory management, revenue tracking, and customer behavior analysis.

📁 Repository Structure

The code is organized into folders representing different stages of database work and complexity.

Folder

Content

Focus

00_Schema

Contains the setup files for the database.

Database Setup

Queries/Intermediate

Focuses on basic business questions using joins and aggregations.

Data Retrieval

Queries/Advanced

Features complex analytical queries (CTEs, Window Functions, Subqueries).

Business Intelligence

Procedures

Scripts for Stored Procedures and Views.

Automation & Views

📊 Key Analysis Areas (Sakila Schema)

My scripts address common business challenges faced by the Sakila rental store:

Inventory Optimization: Identifying overstocked/understocked films and tracking rental rates by category.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculating the total rental revenue generated by specific customers.

Revenue Performance: Analyzing daily, monthly, and quarterly sales trends using complex date functions.

Ranking and Segmentation: Using window functions to rank films by popularity within their respective categories and segmenting customers based on rental frequency.

💻 Included Files

Filepath

Description

00_Schema/create sakila db.sql

The foundational file. Contains the Data Definition Language (DDL) and constraints necessary to build the entire Sakila database structure.

Queries/Intermediate/rental_summary.sql

Simple queries joining customer, rental, and payment tables to produce basic sales reports.

Queries/Advanced/top_rentals_ranking.sql

Utilizes Window Functions (RANK(), DENSE_RANK()) to find the most popular films per store and per category.

Queries/Advanced/monthly_revenue_cte.sql

Uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate monthly rolling averages of payment revenue.

Procedures/sp_get_film_details.sql

A Stored Procedure that accepts a film ID and returns the title, rental rate, and the count of available copies across all stores.

✨ Skills Demonstrated

Database Design: Understanding of normalized schemas (e.g., Star Schema concepts in a transaction database).

Advanced Querying: Mastery of JOIN types, GROUP BY, HAVING, and complex subqueries.

Analytical Functions: Effective use of ROW_NUMBER(), LAG(), and LEAD() for sequential analysis.

Performance Optimization: Writing efficient queries and utilizing indexes (implicitly demonstrated via schema setup).

Procedural SQL: Creation of reusable, modular logic via Stored Procedures.
